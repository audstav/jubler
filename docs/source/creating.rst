.. _open:

Opening a New Subtitle File
-----------------------------

Before creating your subtitles, you need to create a new subtitling project. 

To create a new subtitling project:

1. In the interface, click the **New** button |newbutton|.

.. |newbutton| image:: /images/new_button.png
               :scale: 65 %

2. 2. A new, blank file will appear.

.. _import:

Importing Subtitles from an External File
-------------------------------------------

If you already have your subtitles typed out in a text file (e.g., Notepad), you can import the file into Jubler.

.. image:: /images/import_file.png

1. To locate the external file, click the **Load Screen** button at the top of the interface.
2. In the window that appears, select the file you want to upload.
3. To confirm the selection, click **Open**. The subtitles will now appear in the interface.

.. _adjust:

Importing and Adjusting the Appearance of your Video and Audio file
----------------------------------------------------------------------

.. image:: /images/adjust.png

1. Click on the eye button.
2. To choose your movie file, click **Browse** to the right of the text field.
3. To use another audio file (rather than the one that comes with your video), check the box titled “**Use a different audio stream.**” A pop-up window will appear from where you can select your alternate audio file. Otherwise, leave the box unchecked.
4. To confirm your selection, click **OK**. The movie will now appear in the Jubler interface.

.. admonition:: Remember
   
   By default, the audio track is also displayed with the video preview. Jubler needs to be in full screen for the video and audio track to be displayed side-by-side.

.. _preview:

Selecting and Previewing a specific Audio Section
----------------------------------------------------

.. image:: /images/preview.png

1. To select the section of audio you would like to subtitle, click on the blue area and drag it left or right to position it over the audio waveform. To drag out and adjust the edges of the blue area, hover your mouse over the edge until it changes to a double-headed arrow. Click and drag the edge of the blue area as desired.
2. To hear where the audio has been positioned, press the speaker button  on the left-hand sidebar menu. You will hear the audio that corresponds to the blue area selected. The video preview will automatically find the still image in the video that corresponds to that part of the audio.
